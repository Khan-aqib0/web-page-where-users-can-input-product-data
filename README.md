Retrieve the input data and display it in bar graphs for price and ratings.
Implement sorting functionality for both price and ratings graphs.
Ensure that adding new data dynamically updates the graphs.
Manipulate the CSS to visually represent the bar graphs without using any external libraries.
Submission Guidelines
